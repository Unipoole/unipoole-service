<!-- 
    Loading the config file:
    Hazelcast will look into two places for the configuration file:
    -   System property: Hazelcast will first check if "hazelcast.config" system 
        property is set to a file path. Example: -Dhazelcast.config=C:/myhazelcast.xml.
    -   Classpath: If config file is not set as a system property, Hazelcast will 
        check classpath for hazelcast.xml file.

            <!--
            If multicast is not preferred way of discovery for your environment,
            then you can configure Hazelcast for full TCP/IP cluster. As 
            configuration below shows, while enable attribute of multicast is 
            set to false, tcp-ip has to be set to true. For the none-multicast 
            option, all or subset of cluster members' hostnames and/or ip 
            addresses must be listed. Note that all of the cluster members don't
            have to be listed there but at least one of them has to be active in 
            cluster when a new member joins. The tcp-ip tag accepts an attribute 
            called "connection-timeout-seconds". The default value is 5. 
            Increasing this value is recommended if you have many IP's listed 
            and members can not properly build up the cluster. 
            -->

            <!--
            You can also specify which network interfaces that Hazelcast should use. 
            Servers mostly have more than one network interface so you may want to 
            list the valid IPs. Range characters ('*' and '-') can be used for 
            simplicity. So 10.3.10.*, for instance, refers to IPs between 10.3.10.0 
            and 10.3.10.255. Interface 10.3.10.4-18 refers to IPs between 10.3.10.4 
            and 10.3.10.18 (4 and 18 included). If network interface configuration 
            is enabled (disabled by default) and if Hazelcast cannot find an matching 
            interface, then it will print a message on console and won't start on that node.
